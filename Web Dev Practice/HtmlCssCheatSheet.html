      <!-- pro tip: you can use "height:300px;height:500px;" to set the size of a picture in pixels.  Use the style attribute, though and set it to 100% in CSS because that'll keep your style sheet from changing image sizes.-->
      <p><button>This is a button</button></p>
         What does it do?
         <ul>
            <li>milk</li>
            <li>eggs</li>
            <li>something else</li>
            what happens when you just throw a line in here?
            <li>Nothing else</li>
         </ul>
         <br>
         <ol>

      <p>Here's a thing</p>
      <hr>
      <hr>
      <p>Here's another</p>
      <br>
      <pre>Let's  try   something    new.</pre>
      <p>Let's  try   something    new.</p>
      <p style="text-align:center;"> Text aligned to center.</p>

      <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_formatting.asp">This is where you left off.</a>
      <hr>
      <p>Also, this probably isn't how you're supposed to use "HR" tags...</p>
      <b>This text is bold, using "b"</b>
      <strong>This text is important because I used "strong"</strong>
      <i>This text is italicized because I used "i"</i>
      <em>This text is emphasized because I used "em"</em>
      <mark>This text is marked because I used "mark"</mark>
      <small>This text is small because I used "small"</small>
      <del>This text is deleted? del</del>
      <ins>This text is inserted? ins</ins>
      <sub>This text is subscript because I used "sub"</sub>
      <sup>super script because "sup"</sup>
      <p>and all that was on the same line because you didn't use "P"</p>
      <p>It's possible to <q>quote stuff</q> using "Q" </p>
      <p>or</p>
      <blockquote>you can use the blockquote tag to make a block of quotes, I guess.  The example given by the tutorial also includes citing information from other websites.  I'm not sure what that's about, but I'm going to check right now.</blockquote>
      <p><abbr>abbr for abbreviations</abbr></p>
      <p><address>You can tag something as an address like this</address></p>
      <strong>Tags like these are really just used to communicate information to a browser.  They don't really make any difference to the reader.</strong>
      <p>These things communicate with the browser</p>
         <ul>
            <li>strong</li>
            <li>em</li>
            <li>quote</li>
            <li>blockquote</li>
            <li>title</li>
            <li>h1-h6</li>
            <li>address</li>
            <li>cite</li>
            <li>abbr</li><br>
            There's probably a bunch of other things.  I really wonder how much the browser reads into what you type.<br>
            For instance, does it see a difference between br and p?<br>
            The world may never know.
         </ul>
      <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr>
      <br> That's dope.  So this provides a subtitle to explain abbreviations.

      <br>Did you know that you could add color to each element?
      <br><h4 style="background-color:blanchedalmond;">We gotta get to that vapor wave bro</h4>
      <p style="background-color:magenta;">That's the stuff</p>
      <p style="color:aquamarine; background-color:blueviolet;">My god, it's so easy.  This line look like a wildberry poptart, my dudes.  These descriptors totally stack, though.  That's rad.</p>
      <p style="border:5px solid indigo; background-color:aqua; color:magenta;">If you use enough of these style tags, it almost looks like code.</p>
      <p style="border:5pc solid greenyellow;">My dream is to make something so painful to look at that it will never be read.</p>
      <p style="border:5pt solid teal;">But my main goal is to blow up and act like I don't know nobody.</p>
